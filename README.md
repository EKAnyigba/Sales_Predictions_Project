Predict sale volume based on several features.

The first image shows the total sales based on the establishment of the outlet. This shows that the oldest establishment has the largest sale - with the exception of the anomaly in the middle ![alt text](sales.png)

This second plot shots the volume of sale of regular vrs low fat dairy products ![alt text](sales2.png)

The last plot shows that there is a lot section of the data that is out of the norm for sales volume for both regular and low fat dairy items ![alt text](sales3.png)

# Linear regression models using SKlearn KNeighbours and SKlearn Linear regression
Sales_prediction_Machine LearningKNN 2.ipynb - used KNeighbours to build the regression model with a tunable K factor
Sales_prediction_Machine Learning Linear 2.ipynb  - Used the linear regression model to predict sales volume
